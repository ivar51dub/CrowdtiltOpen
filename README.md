## Please Note

The open source version of Tilt Open contained in this repo is no longer in active development and we are no longer issuing Sandbox API credentials.

Please visit [tilt.com/pro](https://tilt.com/pro) to see the newest features we've added to the hosted version.

## Install

### Dependencies
To run Tilt Open you'll need the following prerequisites installed:

* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (for downloading software packages)

```
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) (version control)

```
$ brew install git
```
* RVM, ruby 1.9.3, and the Rails gem

```
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails --ruby=1.9.3
$ rvm use 1.9.3 --default
```
* [Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup) (database)

* [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) (image processing software)

```
$ brew install imagemagick
```

* If you recently upgraded to OS X Mavericks (10.9) or got a new Mac computer and are having issues with the json gem during the bundle process, you may need to install the Command Line Developer Tools using the following command and clicking Install when prompted:

```
$ xcode-select --install
```

### Local Setup

Get  started by:

* Downloading a .zip of the [latest release](https://github.com/Crowdtilt/CrowdtiltOpen/releases) to your local machine

  or

* Creating a fork of Tilt Open and cloning it to your local machine.



After you've got the repo on your local machine, switch to the newly created project directory

```
$ cd {DIRECTORY}
```

Create a .env file in the project rootâ€¦easiest way is to create a copy of the .env.example file


```
$ cp .env.example .env
```


Then open up the .env file and fill in the variables with your app_name and credentials. Leave `ENABLE_ASSET_SYNC` set to 'true' if you plan to use AWS to host your assets (recommended). The bucket for asset syncing should be in the US Standard (us-east-1) zone.

Generate your `SECRET_TOKEN`  and `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` by running the following command from the root of your project directory.

Do NOT reuse the same secret token - you'll need to generate it twice.

```
$ foreman run rake secret
```

Important: Your `APP_NAME` must not have a space in it. Underscores and hypens are accepted.

Your .env file should look something like this:

```
APP_NAME=myawesomeapp
CROWDTILT_SANDBOX_KEY=crowdtiltsandboxkey
CROWDTILT_SANDBOX_SECRET=crowdtiltsandboxsecret
ENABLE_ASSET_SYNC=true
AWS_BUCKET=awsbucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=awsaccesskey
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=awssecretaccesskey
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=myawesomeapp.mailgun.org
MAILGUN_PASSWORD=mailgunpassword
MAILGUN_USERNAME=postmaster@myawesomeapp.mailgun.org
SECRET_TOKEN=secrettoken
DEVISE_SECRET_KEY=secrettoken
```

Install the gems

```
$ bundle install
```

Create and migrate the DB

```
$ foreman run rake db:create
$ foreman run rake db:migrate
```

Start the server

```
$ foreman start
```

Run the console

```
$ foreman run rails c
```

### Deploying to Heroku

1. [Sign up for a Heroku Account](https://www.heroku.com/)
2. [Install the Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)

Create a new Heroku app

```
$ heroku create {APP NAME}
```

Install the Heroku config plugin if you don't already have it installed

```
$ heroku plugins:install git://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config.git
```

Push the configuration to Heroku.
NOTE: If you have already written config vars to Heroku, they will not be overwritten unless you pass the `--overwrite` flag as well.

```
$ heroku config:push
```

Deploy the code to Heroku

```
$ git push heroku master
```

Migrate the database

```
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
```

Launch the app!

```
$ heroku open
```

(Optional) It is highly recommended to install the Papertrail addon to create searchable logs should you run into issues. The "choklad" level is free.

```
$ heroku addons:add papertrail:choklad
```
